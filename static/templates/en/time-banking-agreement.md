**Service Area:** [Geographic area or community]  
**Established:** [Date]  
**Platform:** [Software used, if any]

## 1. What is Time Banking?

Time banking is a reciprocity-based system where people exchange services using time as currency. One hour of any person's time equals one hour of anyone else's time—recognizing that everyone's contributions have equal value.

### Core Principles

**1. Everyone Has Something to Offer**
- All skills and abilities are valued
- No service is "worth more" than another
- We all have gifts to share

**2. Time is Equal**
- One hour = one time credit, regardless of service
- A lawyer's hour = a gardener's hour = a babysitter's hour
- This challenges market-based valuations

**3. Building Community**
- Beyond transactions, we build relationships
- Strengthening social fabric
- Creating interdependence and mutual support

**4. Meeting Real Needs**
- Exchange what we actually need and can offer
- Practical help and skill sharing
- Reducing reliance on money economy

**5. Reciprocity, Not Charity**
- Both giving and receiving
- Everyone contributes according to ability
- Dignity in exchange

## 2. How Time Banking Works

### The Basic Exchange
1. **Offer services:** What you can provide
2. **Request services:** What you need
3. **Make a match:** Connect with other members
4. **Provide service:** Give your time (1 hour = 1 credit earned)
5. **Receive service:** Use your credits (1 hour = 1 credit spent)
6. **Record the exchange:** Log hours with coordinator

### Starting Balance
- New members start with: [0 credits / Small starting balance like 2-5]
- Can go into "debt": [Yes, up to -X credits / No]
- Philosophy: Trust that what goes around comes around

### Time Credits
- **Earning:** Provide service to member = earn credits
