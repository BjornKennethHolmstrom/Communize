**Adopted:** [Date]  
**Last Reviewed:** [Date]

## 1. Our Approach to Conflict

We recognize that conflict is a natural part of community life. Rather than avoiding it, we commit to working through disagreements with respect, honesty, and care for relationships.

### Core Beliefs
- Conflict can strengthen relationships and clarify values
- Everyone deserves to be heard and respected
- We assume good intentions unless proven otherwise
- Resolution requires participation from all involved
- The goal is understanding and repair, not winning

### When Conflicts Arise
We commit to addressing them:
- **Promptly:** Within [1 week] of becoming aware
- **Directly:** With those involved, not through gossip
- **Respectfully:** Focusing on behaviors and impacts, not character
- **Hopefully:** Believing resolution is possible

## 2. Types of Conflict

### Interpersonal Conflicts
- Personality clashes
- Miscommunication
- Hurt feelings
- Boundary violations
- Trust issues

### Structural Conflicts
- Role confusion
- Resource scarcity
- Power imbalances
- Unclear agreements
- Competing needs

### Value Conflicts
- Different priorities
- Philosophical disagreements
- Cultural differences
- Ethical concerns
- Vision misalignment

## 3. The Five-Step Process

### Step 1: Pause and Self-Reflect
Before engaging, take time to:

**Clarify Your Experience:**
- What specifically happened?
- How did it affect you?
- What needs of yours were not met?
- What part did you play?

**Check Your Assumptions:**
- What story am I telling myself?
- Could there be another explanation?
- What don't I know about their perspective?

**Consider Timing:**
- Am I calm enough to engage constructively?
- Is this the right time and place?
- Do I need support first?

**Time for this step:** [A few hours to 1-2 days maximum]

### Step 2: Direct Conversation
Whenever possible, speak directly with the person involved.

**Requesting a Conversation:**
- "I'd like to talk about [situation]. When would be a good time?"
- Choose a neutral, private location
- Allow time (at least 30-60 minutes)
- Consider having a support person present (if both agree)

**During the Conversation:**

**Use "I" Statements:**
- ✅ "I felt hurt when..."
- ✅ "I need..."
- ✅ "I'm concerned about..."
- ❌ "You always..."
- ❌ "You never..."
- ❌ "You made me..."

**Describe Specific Behaviors:**
- ✅ "When you left without cleaning up..."
- ✅ "When the deadline passed without communication..."
- ❌ "You're so irresponsible..."
- ❌ "You don't care about anyone..."

**Listen Actively:**
- Repeat back what you hear: "So you're saying..."
- Ask clarifying questions: "Can you help me understand...?"
- Notice non-verbal cues
- Allow silence for processing

**Seek Understanding:**
- What was their intention?
- What needs were they trying to meet?
- What was happening for them?
- Where's the misunderstanding?

**Look for Solutions:**
- What would repair look like?
- What needs to change going forward?
- What can each person commit to?
- How will we know it's resolved?

**If Successful:**
- Acknowledge the difficulty of the conversation
- Express appreciation for engagement
- Confirm agreements
- Follow up: [Check in after 1 week]

**If Not Successful:**
- That's okay—move to Step 3
- Acknowledge the attempt
- Take a break if needed

### Step 3: Mediated Conversation
If direct conversation doesn't resolve the issue, request mediation.

**Choosing a Mediator:**
- Someone both parties trust
- Not directly involved in the conflict
- Trained or experienced in mediation [if possible]
- Committed to impartiality

**The Mediation Process:**

**1. Opening (10 minutes)**
- Mediator explains process and ground rules
- Confirms confidentiality (except safety concerns)
- Each person agrees to participate respectfully

**2. Individual Storytelling (15-20 min each)**
- Each person shares their perspective uninterrupted
- Mediator may ask clarifying questions
- Other person listens without defending

**3. Reflection (10 minutes)**
- Mediator summarizes what they've heard
- Identifies common ground
- Names underlying needs and concerns

**4. Dialogue (30-45 minutes)**
- Facilitated back-and-forth conversation
- Focus on understanding, not convincing
- Mediator keeps conversation constructive

**5. Problem-Solving (20-30 minutes)**
- Brainstorm possible solutions
- Evaluate options together
- Seek creative third ways

**6. Agreement (10 minutes)**
- Document what was decided
- Specify concrete actions and timeline
- Plan for follow-up
- Acknowledge the work done

**7. Closing**
- Express what you appreciate about the process
- Commit to the agreement
- Thank the mediator

**If Successful:**
- Written summary to both parties
- Follow-up: [After 2 weeks and 1 month]

**If Not Successful:**
- May need multiple sessions
- Consider different mediator
- Or move to Step 4

### Step 4: Community Circle
When individual efforts haven't resolved the conflict, bring it to the wider community.

**When to Use Community Circle:**
- Conflict affects whole group
- Individuals need community support
- Pattern of behavior that concerns multiple people
- Mediation unsuccessful
- Structural or policy issues involved

**Requesting a Community Circle:**
- Submit request to [facilitation team / coordinator]
- Provide brief written summary
- All involved parties notified
- Scheduled within [1 week]

**Circle Format:**

**1. Opening (5 minutes)**
- Facilitator welcomes all
- Explains circle process
- Sets intentions and ground rules

**2. Creating Safe Space (10 minutes)**
- Brief check-in from each person
- Acknowledgment of difficulty
- Commitment to respectful listening

**3. Story Rounds (20-30 minutes)**
- Each involved party shares their experience
- Others listen without interruption
- Talking piece ensures one voice at a time

**4. Witness Reflections (15-20 minutes)**
- Community members share observations
- Offer perspective, not judgment
- Name patterns or context

**5. Exploration (20-30 minutes)**
- Open dialogue about the situation
- Questions for understanding
- Acknowledgment of complexity

**6. Collective Wisdom (20 minutes)**
- What does the community see?
- What values are at stake?
- What needs attention?
- What would healing look like?

**7. Pathways Forward (20-30 minutes)**
- Possible solutions or approaches
- What can the community offer?
- What do individuals need to commit to?
- Structural changes needed?

**8. Agreements (10 minutes)**
- Document decisions and commitments
- Assign accountability partners
- Set follow-up date
- Thank everyone for participation

**9. Closing (5 minutes)**
- Appreciations
- Acknowledgment of courage
- Closing words or ritual

**After the Circle:**
- Written summary distributed
- Check-ins with involved parties
- Follow-through on commitments
- Review: [After 1 month]

### Step 5: External Support
If internal processes haven't resolved the conflict:

**Options:**
- **Professional mediator:** Trained external neutral party
- **Restorative justice facilitator:** Focuses on harm and repair
- **Therapist/counselor:** For deeper interpersonal work
- **Organizational consultant:** For systemic issues
- **Legal counsel:** If legal matters involved

**When to Seek External Help:**
- Safety concerns
- Power imbalances that can't be addressed internally
- Repeated pattern without improvement
- Complexity beyond community's capacity
- Violation of laws or serious agreements

**Process:**
- Community decides together to seek outside help
- Research and vet potential facilitators
- Budget from [conflict resolution fund / general fund]
- All parties agree to participate
- Follow external facilitator's process

## 5. Special Situations

### Power Dynamics
When there's a power imbalance (age, role, identity, etc.):

**Acknowledge it:** Name the dynamic openly

**Accountability Process:**
1. Harmed person's needs centered

### When Someone Won't Engage
If a person refuses to participate in resolution:

- Proceed without them if necessary
- Consider: [Suspension / Removal from community]

**Document:**

### Recurring Conflicts
If same issue keeps arising:

**This Signals:**

**Response:**

## 8. Documentation

Reflect together:

Sometimes despite best efforts, resolution cannot be reached.

**Parting Ways:**
