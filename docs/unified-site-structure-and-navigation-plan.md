Perfect — this integration of **Communize.org** with the **Global Governance Frameworks (GGF)** ecosystem opens up a coherent “fourth pillar” in your family of sites, linking the *inner*, *developmental*, and *collective* into the *systemic*.

Here’s a **unified site structure and navigation plan** for **Communize.org**, designed to harmonize with *Nondualize*, *Spiralize*, and *GGF*, while staying static-first and contribution-friendly.

## 🧭 **Communize.org – Unified Structure & Navigation Plan**

### 🌐 Core Purpose

> **Communize.org** explores the art and architecture of belonging — how we create, sustain, and evolve commons at every scale of life.
> It bridges **inner integration (Nondualize)**, **developmental growth (Spiralize)**, and **systemic coherence (GGF)** through the *verb* of communizing.

Would you like me to **turn this plan into a folder + file structure (like a scaffold for your 11ty project)** next — with example filenames, directory hierarchy, and index content placeholders for each section? That would make it immediately actionable for starting the site build.
