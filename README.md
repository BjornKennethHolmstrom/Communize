# Communize

**Communize** is a philosophical and practical exploration of **building community and creating the commons**. It investigates the process of *communizing*‚Äîthe active verb of fostering shared ownership, collective responsibility, and deep relational bonds.

As a statically-hosted, open-source sister site to [spiralize.org](https://spiralize.org) (Spiral Dynamics) and [nondualize.org](https://nondualize.org) (Nondualism), it extends the exploration of human development and consciousness into the social and structural realm. **No backend, no databases, no tracking‚Äîjust ideas and resources.**

## üåü **Our Inquiry**

Communize is built on the premise that the future of human flourishing is collective. We investigate:

*   **The Process of Communizing:** What does it mean to "make communal"? How do we transform isolated ownership into shared stewardship?
*   **The Psychology of Belonging:** What are the human needs for connection, and how do healthy communities fulfill them?
*   **The Structures of Collaboration:** From ancient commons to digital cooperatives, we study models that enable people to manage shared resources.
*   **Communizing as an Antidote:** How does building community address modern crises of loneliness, ecological degradation, and economic inequality?

## üîë **Pillars of Exploration** (Static-First Approach)

### **1. Philosophical & Psychological Foundations**
- **Core Essays:** Foundational texts on the theory of the commons, gift economies, and communalism.
- **Integrated Insights:** Connections between Spiral Dynamics, Nondualism, and community building.
- **Glossary:** Key terms like "communize," "commoning," "reciprocity," and "resilience."

### **2. Models & Praxis Library**
- **Case Studies:** Markdown-based profiles of successful ecovillages, housing co-ops, and worker-owned businesses.
- **Practical Guides:** Step-by-step instructions for starting a tool library, forming a babysitting cooperative, or establishing a community garden.
- **Frameworks & Templates:** Downloadable PDF agreements for resource sharing, meeting facilitation guides, and decision-making flowcharts.

### **3. The Communize Toolkit**
Instead of dynamic web apps, we provide:
- **Static Resource Mapper:** A single HTML page with JavaScript that lets users manually list and categorize their local shared resources, which can be saved/printed.
- **Curated Tool Directory:** A manually maintained list of **external** open-source and freemium platforms (e.g., Loomio for decision-making, Cobudget for participatory budgeting) with reviews and use-cases.
- **DIY Worksheet Generator:** Simple HTML forms that generate printable PDF worksheets for community asset mapping or project planning.

### **4. The Knowledge Commons**
- **Curated Reading Lists:** Thematically organized lists of books, essays, and films.
- **Link Library:** A vast, categorized collection of links to external organizations, projects, and research papers.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack (Simple & Static)**

This entire project is built for **GitHub Pages**:
- **Framework:** 11ty (Eleventy) or plain HTML + Markdown for ultimate simplicity and speed.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS or simple CSS for a clean, accessible design.
- **Interactivity:** Minimal, vanilla JavaScript for client-side features like filters and simple form generators.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (free, simple, and perfectly suited for this content-based site).
- **Content:** All content written in Markdown, easy for anyone to contribute to.

## üöÄ **Our Path Forward**

1.  **Phase 1: The Core** - Launch with 5-10 foundational essays, the glossary, and the initial Models & Praxis library (10-15 case studies/guides).
2.  **Phase 2: Expand the Toolkit** - Add the static Resource Mapper and DIY Worksheets. Grow the link library and reading lists.
3.  **Phase 3: Community Curation** - Actively solicit and integrate contributions from the community to expand the case studies and practical guides.

## üåç **From Isolation to Communion**

**Communize.org** is an invitation to participate in the great work of our time: weaving the social fabric back together. It is a call to move from a world of "me" to a world of "we," not by losing the self, but by finding it in a wider context of belonging and mutual care.

**Let's communize.**
