# Conflict as Commons

We treat conflict like it's a problem to be solved, an enemy to be defeated, or—if we're conflict-avoidant—a danger to be escaped. But what if we've misunderstood what conflict actually is?

What if conflict isn't a breakdown in the relationship, but a *resource* the relationship generates? What if it's not something to eliminate, but something to *tend*—a commons that requires skillful stewardship?

This reframe changes everything about how we navigate disagreement.

## The Conventional View: Conflict as Threat

Most of us learned one of two basic strategies for dealing with conflict:

**Fight**: Engage aggressively. Win the argument. Prove you're right. Dominate or be dominated.

**Flight**: Avoid at all costs. Keep the peace. Don't rock the boat. Suppress your needs to maintain harmony.

Both strategies treat conflict as fundamentally negative—something that shouldn't be happening. The goal is to get back to "normal" as quickly as possible, either through victory or avoidance.

But notice what both strategies have in common: they treat conflict as an individual problem requiring an individual solution. "How do *I* win?" or "How do *I* escape?"

What if that's the wrong question?

## Conflict as Generated by Difference

Here's a different starting point: conflict arises naturally wherever there are two or more people with different needs, preferences, perspectives, or rhythms trying to share a space.

It's not a failure. It's not a sign that something's wrong with the relationship. It's an inevitable byproduct of *diversity meeting intimacy*.

Think about it: if you and your partner (or friend, or collaborator) were exactly the same, you'd never disagree—but you also wouldn't have much to offer each other. The very differences that make the relationship rich and generative are the same differences that create friction.

Conflict, then, is the relational system's way of saying: "There are multiple valid perspectives here that need to be held and integrated."

This is information. This is *wealth*—the diversity of the commons showing up as creative tension.

## The Commons Perspective

If we shift from seeing conflict as a problem to seeing it as a *resource*, what changes?

A resource can be:
- **Wasted** (through destructive fighting)
- **Ignored** (through conflict avoidance)
- **Hoarded** (through one person always "winning")
- **Skillfully tended** (through conscious engagement)

When conflict is treated as commons:
- It belongs to both/all people involved (not just the one who's "upset")
- It requires collective stewardship (both people are responsible for how it unfolds)
- It can be enriched or depleted (depending on how it's handled)
- It produces something valuable when tended well (deeper understanding, creative solutions, increased trust)

The question isn't "How do I make conflict go away?" but "How do we tend this conflict so it enriches our relationship rather than depleting it?"

## What Conflict Offers

When tended as commons, conflict becomes a portal to:

### 1. **Hidden Needs Coming to Light**

Conflict often signals that someone's needs aren't being met—needs that might not have been visible before. This is valuable information about what the relationship system requires to function well.

The conflict isn't the problem. The unmet need is. And now you know about it.

### 2. **Assumptions Being Revealed**

Disagreement shows us where we've been operating on different assumptions—about what's normal, what's fair, what matters, what's expected. Making these assumptions explicit is essential for co-creating shared agreements.

### 3. **Growth Edges Being Touched**

We often conflict at our edges—the places where we're still learning, where we're triggered, where we're not yet integrated. Conflict invites us to grow, if we're willing.

### 4. **Intimacy Deepening**

Paradoxically, well-tended conflict creates more intimacy, not less. When you can show up with each other in disagreement and still maintain connection, trust deepens. You learn: "We can weather this. We can be different and still belong to each other."

## The Tragedy of Conflict Commons

Like any commons, conflict can be mismanaged in predictable ways:

### **The Tragedy of Overuse**

One person dominates the conflict space—always initiating fights, always bringing up issues, always demanding resolution *now*. The other person gets exhausted and withdraws.

This is overgrazing the commons. The resource (the relationship's capacity to hold difference) gets depleted.

### **The Tragedy of Underuse**

Both people avoid conflict entirely. Nothing ever gets addressed. Resentments build. The relationship becomes superficial, with a thick layer of "niceness" covering the real.

This is letting the commons go fallow. The resource atrophies from disuse.

### **The Tragedy of Privatization**

One person tries to "win" every conflict, treating disagreement as a power struggle. Their needs always trump the other person's. Their perspective is always "right."

This is enclosure—treating the commons as private property. And like all enclosures, it leads to resentment, rebellion, or resignation.

## Tending Conflict as Commons

So how do we actually steward conflict well? Here are some principles:

### 1. **Shared Responsibility**

Both people are responsible for *how* the conflict unfolds, regardless of who's "right" or who initiated.

This means:
- Both people regulate their own nervous systems
- Both people stay engaged (neither totally dominates nor totally withdraws)
- Both people listen as well as speak
- Both people are curious about the other's experience

Even if you didn't "cause" the conflict, you're still responsible for how you show up in it.

### 2. **Slowing Down**

Most conflict damage happens at speed. When we're activated, we move fast—fast speech, fast reactions, fast decisions.

Tending the commons means slowing down:
- Taking breaks when things get too hot
- Pausing before responding
- Asking for time to process
- Not making permanent decisions in temporary emotional states

Slow conflict is more sustainable than fast conflict.

### 3. **Naming What's Happening**

Make the conflict visible and named:
- "I notice we're in conflict right now."
- "This feels like an important disagreement to work through."
- "I'm feeling activated—can we slow this down?"

Naming it creates a shared reality. You're not fighting *about* the conflict; you're in it *together*, trying to tend it.

### 4. **Curiosity Over Certainty**

The death of conflict-as-commons is when both people become completely certain they're right and the other is wrong.

Tending well means maintaining curiosity:
- "Help me understand your perspective."
- "What am I missing?"
- "What does this situation look like from your side?"

Curiosity keeps the commons open. Certainty closes it down.

### 5. **Holding Multiple Truths**

The goal isn't for one person's truth to win. The goal is to hold both/all truths simultaneously until something larger emerges.

This is the wisdom of the commons: many perspectives, each partial, together creating a more complete picture.

You can be hurt *and* they didn't mean to hurt you.
You can need space *and* they can need closeness.
You can be right *and* they can be right *and* both can be true.

### 6. **Repair as Practice**

Conflict will sometimes cause damage—harsh words, ruptured connection, hurt feelings. This isn't failure; it's inevitable.

What matters is *repair*:
- Acknowledging when you've caused harm
- Making amends
- Recommitting to better patterns
- Returning to connection

Repair is how you restore the commons after depletion. It's essential maintenance.

## Different Conflict Styles

People have different natural relationships to conflict, shaped by temperament, culture, and family history:

**Pursuers** tend to lean into conflict—wanting to address issues immediately, talk things through, get resolution.

**Withdrawers** tend to lean away—needing space to process, feeling overwhelmed by intensity, preferring to wait until calm.

Neither is wrong. But when these patterns clash (a common pairing!), it can feel like the other person is attacking (to the withdrawer) or abandoning (to the pursuer).

Tending conflict as commons means:
- Understanding your own pattern
- Understanding the other's pattern
- Finding rhythms that work for both (address the issue, but with breaks; create safety for intensity and space for processing)

The pattern itself isn't the problem. The problem is when one pattern dominates and the other gets suppressed.

## Conflict Rituals

Just as communities create rituals for maintaining physical commons, relationships benefit from rituals for tending conflict:

**The Repair Ritual**: A specific structure for coming back together after rupture. This might include:
- Taking turns speaking and listening without interruption
- Each person naming their experience and taking responsibility for their part
- Physical reconnection (holding hands, hugging) when ready
- Explicit acknowledgment: "We're okay. We're still here."

**The Weekly Check-In**: A regular time to address small issues before they become big ones. "Anything we need to talk about? Anything bothering you? How's our connection feeling?"

**The Time-Out Agreement**: A pre-negotiated protocol for when things get too hot. "I need a break" isn't abandonment—it's responsible self-regulation. But you agree on how long the break will be and when you'll come back to talk.

These rituals create predictability and safety, which makes the conflict commons less scary to enter.

## When Conflict Becomes Destructive

Not all conflict is healthy. The commons can be degraded beyond sustainability.

Warning signs:
- **Contempt**: Eye-rolling, mockery, character attacks, disgust
- **Criticism**: Attacking the person rather than addressing the behavior
- **Defensiveness**: Refusing responsibility, always deflecting
- **Stonewalling**: Complete withdrawal, shutting down, refusing to engage

John Gottman calls these the "Four Horsemen" of relationship destruction. When these patterns dominate, the conflict commons has become toxic.

At that point, outside help (therapy, mediation) is often needed to restore the system's capacity to hold difference without destruction.

## The Gift of Conflict

Here's the paradox: relationships that never have conflict are often shallow. The depth comes not from avoiding difference, but from learning to *meet* in difference.

When you know you can disagree and still belong to each other, something profound happens. You relax. You can be more fully yourself. You don't have to pretend or perform perfect harmony.

The relationship becomes a place where all of you—including your difficult, messy, contradictory parts—can show up.

This is the gift of well-tended conflict: it creates a commons spacious enough to hold the full complexity of being human.

## Conflict Across Scales

The skills for tending conflict in intimate relationships transfer directly to all other scales:

**In teams**: How do you create a culture where disagreement enriches rather than threatens?

**In communities**: How do you handle the inevitable friction when many people try to share resources and make decisions?

**In movements**: How do you hold diverse perspectives and strategies without fracturing?

The patterns are identical:
- Shared responsibility
- Slowing down
- Curiosity
- Holding multiple truths
- Rituals for repair
- Vigilance against destructive patterns

If you can't tend conflict at the intimate scale, you'll struggle at larger scales. The relational is the training ground for the communal.

## Conclusion: Welcoming the Heat

Most of us were taught that good relationships are harmonious—free from conflict, smooth, easy.

But this is a fantasy, and a damaging one. It makes real relationships (which always include friction) feel like failures. It makes conflict feel like an emergency rather than information.

The truth is simpler and harder: good relationships aren't conflict-free. They're conflict-*capable*. They can hold heat without melting down. They can weather disagreement and come out stronger.

This capability isn't innate. It's built through practice—through learning to treat conflict not as an enemy but as a commons, not as a problem but as a resource, not as a sign of failure but as an invitation to deepen.

When we learn this, everything changes. Conflict stops being scary. Difference becomes interesting rather than threatening. The relationship becomes a laboratory for learning how to be in messy, beautiful, complicated connection with another human being.

And that's the foundation for everything else we're trying to build—communities, movements, systems that can hold the full diversity of human experience without collapsing into uniformity or chaos.

It starts here, in the heat between two people, learning to tend the fire without getting burned.
