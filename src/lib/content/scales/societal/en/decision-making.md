# Decision-Making as Commons

Every community, cooperative, and collective eventually faces the same question: *How do we make decisions together?*

This isn't a procedural detail. It's the heart of communizing. How decisions get made reveals everything about power, trust, and whose voices matter. It determines whether a group thrives as a genuine commons or calcifies into hierarchy.

At the societal scale, decision-making itself is a shared resource—a commons that can be enriched or depleted, democratized or enclosed, skillfully tended or allowed to degrade.

## The Default: Tyranny or Chaos

Most groups default to one of two patterns:

**Tyranny**: One person (or a small clique) makes all the decisions. Everyone else follows. Fast, efficient, clear—and ultimately extractive. The "decider" accumulates power; everyone else loses agency.

**Chaos**: No clear process, no agreements, no accountability. Whoever shouts loudest or persists longest gets their way. Energy gets wasted in endless debate. Nothing gets decided, or decisions keep getting reopened.

Both are failures to create a genuine decision-making commons. Both lead to burnout, resentment, and collapse.

The question is: what's the alternative?

## Three Models of Collective Decision-Making

Let's look at three major approaches to communal decision-making, each with its own strengths and shadows.

### 1. Consensus

**The Idea**: Everyone must agree before a decision is made. No one gets overruled. The group moves forward only when all voices are heard and all concerns are addressed.

**The Appeal**: Deeply democratic. No one loses. Maximum buy-in. Honors the sacred nature of each person's perspective.

**The Reality**: 
- **Slow**: Getting everyone to agree takes time—sometimes enormous amounts of time.
- **Vulnerable to blocking**: One person can hold up the entire group. This can be used wisely (preventing harmful decisions) or destructively (personal agenda disguised as principle).
- **Exhausting**: The pressure to agree can lead to pseudo-consensus—people giving in to end the meeting, not because they genuinely consent.
- **Favors the articulate**: Those who can argue longest and most persuasively shape outcomes more than others.

**When it works**: Small groups (≤12 people) with high trust, shared values, and strong facilitation. Groups where relationships matter more than efficiency.

**When it fails**: Large groups, time-sensitive decisions, or groups with significant power differentials where "consensus" masks coercion.

### 2. Majority Rule (Democracy)

**The Idea**: Everyone votes. The option with the most votes wins. Simple, clear, universally understood.

**The Appeal**: Fast. Decisive. Everyone gets a voice. Scales well. Prevents tyranny of the minority.

**The Reality**:
- **Winner-take-all**: 51% can override 49%. The minority loses completely.
- **Polarization**: Encourages binary thinking and coalition-building rather than synthesis.
- **Strategic voting**: People vote for "electable" options rather than what they actually want.
- **Ignores intensity**: Someone mildly preferring A has the same vote as someone whose life depends on not-A.

**When it works**: Large groups, clear binary choices, decisions that don't deeply affect everyone's life.

**When it fails**: Small communities where minority voice matters, decisions requiring genuine buy-in, situations where losers will sabotage implementation.

### 3. Sociocracy (Consent-Based Decision-Making)

**The Idea**: Decisions move forward unless someone has a *principled objection* based on harm to the whole. Not "do you agree?" but "can you live with this?"

**The Core Distinction**: 
- Consensus asks: "Does everyone think this is the best option?"
- Consent asks: "Does anyone think this will cause significant harm?"

**The Process**:
1. Proposal is made
2. Clarifying questions
3. Reaction round (everyone speaks once, no discussion)
4. Objection round: "Do you have a principled objection—a reason this will harm our shared aims?"
5. If objections exist, integrate them into an improved proposal
6. Test for consent again

**The Appeal**: 
- Faster than consensus (you don't need everyone to think it's perfect)
- More inclusive than majority rule (every voice can stop a harmful decision)
- Encourages "good enough for now, safe enough to try"
- Focuses energy on integration rather than argument

**The Reality**:
- **Requires training**: People need to learn the difference between preference and objection
- **Depends on trust**: Works only if people believe objections will be heard
- **Can be gamed**: People can abuse "principled objection" to push personal agendas
- **Still can get stuck**: If objections can't be integrated, you're back to impasse

**When it works**: Groups of 5-50 with shared purpose, willingness to learn the method, and commitment to collective wellbeing.

**When it fails**: Groups with deep power differentials, lack of shared purpose, or insufficient time to learn the practice.

## The Deeper Pattern: Decision-Making as Ritual

Notice what all three models have in common: they're *rituals*—formalized processes for transforming disagreement into direction.

A decision-making commons isn't just about "which model." It's about:

**Shared agreements**: Everyone knows the rules and has consented to them

**Skilled facilitation**: Someone (rotating role) holds the process with care

**Psychological safety**: People can speak without fear of punishment

**Conflict competence**: The group can hold tension without collapsing

**Flexibility**: The process can adapt to the situation

**Accountability**: Decisions made are actually implemented

When these elements are present, almost any method can work. When they're absent, every method fails.

## Power and Voice

Here's what decision-making processes reveal about power:

**Who gets heard?**
- Whose voices are centered in the process?
- Whose concerns are taken seriously?
- Who gets interrupted, talked over, or dismissed?

**Who does the work?**
- Who proposes solutions?
- Who facilitates meetings?
- Who does follow-up?
- Who holds people accountable?

**Who bears the cost?**
- Whose time is valued in the process?
- Who has to educate others about their needs?
- Who has to translate their experience into acceptable language?

A truly commons-based decision process actively counters power differentials:
- Intentionally amplifies marginalized voices
- Rotates facilitation and other roles
- Creates space for those who process differently
- Names and addresses power dynamics
- Makes invisible labor visible and valued

## Nested Decision-Making

At the societal scale, not all decisions should be made the same way or at the same level.

The principle of **subsidiarity** says: decisions should be made at the smallest scale that can effectively address them.

This creates nested decision-making:

**Individual**: You decide what you eat, wear, read, believe

**Household**: You and those you live with decide how to share space, resources, chores

**Neighborhood**: Immediate neighbors decide about shared spaces, noise, parking

**Community**: Broader community decides about schools, parks, local economy

**Bioregion**: Regional decisions about water, ecosystems, shared infrastructure

**Global**: Only truly planetary issues (climate, oceans, pandemics) decided globally

Each level has its own appropriate process. And critically: *higher levels don't override lower levels unless there's a compelling reason related to the wellbeing of the whole*.

This is how you maintain local sovereignty while enabling coordination at scale.

## Example: Hearts Economy Governance

The [Hearts currency system](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/nested-economies) offers a compelling example of nested decision-making in practice:

**Local BAZ (Bioregional Autonomous Zone) Council**: 
- Charters local "Community Providers" (care workers, teachers, healers)
- Sets local Hearts exchange rates for services
- Manages local Hearts treasury
- Decides how to recognize and value local contributions

**Regional Networks**:
- Coordinate Hearts trade between BAZs
- Set regional standards for Hearts backing
- Manage regional Hearts pools for mutual aid

**Social Resilience Council** (global):
- Oversees Hearts supply management
- Ensures ethical standards
- Coordinates across all levels
- But doesn't override local autonomy

Each level governs what it can govern best. Power flows from local up, not global down.

## The Shadow Side: When "Democratic" Processes Aren't

Let's be honest about how decision-making commons can be corrupted:

**Tyranny of Structurelessness**: Claiming "we're non-hierarchical" while informal power structures operate invisibly. Those with more time, confidence, social capital, or insider knowledge dominate—while pretending there's no hierarchy.

**Meeting Exhaustion**: Using endless process to burn out dissent. If you can't attend every 3-hour meeting, your voice doesn't count.

**Consensus as Coercion**: "We all agree, right?" said in a tone that makes disagreement unsafe. Pseudo-consensus where people give in rather than object.

**Majority as Mob**: Using democratic votes to target or exclude minorities. "We voted—you lost—deal with it."

**Technical Gatekeeping**: Making the process so complex that only experts can participate. Jargon, Robert's Rules, procedural complexity as tools of exclusion.

**Token Inclusion**: Including marginalized voices in the room but structuring the process so they can't actually influence decisions.

## Making Decision-Making Accessible

A healthy decision-making commons requires active work to ensure accessibility:

**Temporal**: 
- Hold meetings at times that work for working parents
- Offer childcare
- Record meetings for those who can't attend
- Use asynchronous tools (not just real-time meetings)

**Cognitive**:
- Provide agendas and materials in advance
- Use plain language, not jargon
- Allow different processing styles (written submissions, small group discussion, thinking time)
- Accommodate neurodiversity

**Linguistic**:
- Offer translation
- Slow down for non-native speakers
- Use visuals alongside words

**Economic**:
- Compensate people for their time (especially those less resourced)
- Don't assume everyone can volunteer endlessly
- Recognize care work and other invisible contributions

**Cultural**:
- Honor different cultural norms around speaking, silence, directness
- Don't assume Western communication styles are universal
- Learn from Indigenous decision-making practices

## When Decisions Go Wrong

Even with good process, groups make bad decisions. What then?

**Short-term evaluation**: Set review dates. "We'll try this for 3 months and reassess." Good enough for now, safe enough to try—but not forever.

**Clear accountability**: Who's responsible for implementation? How will we know if it's working?

**Graceful failure**: Create processes for acknowledging "this isn't working" without shame. Experiments can fail; learning matters.

**Repair processes**: When a decision harms some members, how do you acknowledge that and make it right?

**Appeals mechanisms**: What if someone believes a decision violated shared agreements? Who hears appeals? How are they resolved?

The commons of decision-making includes not just making decisions, but learning from them and course-correcting.

## The Connection to Other Scales

How you make decisions at the societal scale teaches skills for every other scale:

**Inner**: Learning to hear your own internal "votes"—the different parts of yourself with different needs.

**Relational**: Practicing "we" decisions—not "yours" or "mine" but "ours."

**Planetary**: Developing capacity to consider multiple perspectives, long time horizons, non-human stakeholders.

The patterns are fractal. If you can't facilitate a meeting with 12 people, you won't be able to coordinate 12,000. If you can't hear a dissenting voice in your household, you won't be able to honor Indigenous sovereignty in global governance.

Practice scales up. Skills transfer.

## Conclusion: The Practice of Shared Power

Decision-making is power made visible. It's where we discover whether our values about equality, inclusion, and collective wisdom are real or rhetorical.

A healthy decision-making commons doesn't eliminate power—it distributes it. It makes power transparent. It creates processes where diverse voices can shape direction together.

This requires:
- Clear processes (rituals everyone knows)
- Skilled facilitation (holding space with care)
- Genuine consent (not just compliance)
- Nested sovereignty (decisions at right scale)
- Continuous learning (what's working? what needs adjustment?)

And perhaps most importantly: **the willingness to be changed by the process**.

Real collective decision-making means you don't always get your way. You enter with your perspective and leave with something different—shaped by others' wisdom, needs, and experience. This isn't compromise in the sense of loss. It's synthesis in the sense of becoming more.

When decision-making becomes a genuine commons—a shared resource tended with care—groups develop collective intelligence greater than any individual. Decisions emerge that no one person would have created alone. The whole becomes genuinely more than the sum of its parts.

This is what it means to communize at the societal scale: to create processes where power flows through us, not over us. Where we govern together, not one another.

It's messy. It's slow. It's sometimes frustrating. And it's the only way to build a world where everyone belongs.
