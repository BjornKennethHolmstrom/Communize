# From Property to Stewardship

The language of property is everywhere: "I own this house." "This is my land." "That's your responsibility." We don't often question it—ownership feels natural, obvious, the way things have always been.

But it hasn't. And it doesn't have to be.

At the heart of communizing is a different relationship to resources: not ownership, but *stewardship*. Not "mine," but "ours." Not control, but care. This shift—from property thinking to commons thinking—is both simple and profound. It changes everything about how we relate to land, housing, resources, and each other.

## The Logic of Property

Property thinking rests on a few core assumptions:

**Exclusion**: Property is defined by who is *excluded*. "This is mine" means "this is not yours." The fence, the title deed, the lock—these are the technologies of exclusion.

**Control**: The owner has the right to use, modify, or destroy what they own. "It's mine; I can do what I want with it."

**Extraction**: Property can be exploited for maximum short-term gain. If I own it, I can extract all its value—regardless of impact on others or future generations.

**Exchange**: Property can be bought and sold. Everything has a price. Everything is a commodity.

This logic makes sense in a certain context—a context of scarcity, competition, and individualism. But it creates predictable problems:

- **Inequality**: Those with property accumulate more; those without fall further behind.
- **Degradation**: Short-term extraction depletes long-term health of ecosystems and communities.
- **Alienation**: We lose connection to place, to each other, to the sources of our lives.
- **Enclosure**: Common resources get privatized, and people lose access to what they once shared.

The history of capitalism is largely the history of enclosure—turning commons into property, shared resources into private wealth.

## The Logic of Stewardship

Stewardship thinking starts from different premises:

**Inclusion**: Resources are shared. Access is a right, not something you must buy. The question isn't "who owns this?" but "who needs this? how do we share it sustainably?"

**Care**: The steward's job is to tend, maintain, and regenerate—not to extract or control. You inherit a resource in trust, care for it well, and pass it on enriched.

**Long-term thinking**: Decisions are made for seven generations (or longer). The health of the system matters more than short-term gain.

**Reciprocity**: What you take, you give back. What you use, you restore. The relationship is mutual, not extractive.

In stewardship thinking, you don't own the land—the land allows you to dwell on it, and in return, you care for it. You don't own the house—you live in it, maintain it, and eventually pass it to others who will do the same.

## Historical Roots

This isn't new-age fantasy. It's how most human societies functioned for most of human history.

**Indigenous Stewardship**: Many Indigenous cultures never developed concepts of land ownership. Land was sacred, alive, shared. You belonged to the land; the land didn't belong to you. Stewardship was collective, intergenerational, and reciprocal.

**European Commons**: Before enclosure, much of Europe operated on commons—shared pastures, forests, fisheries. These weren't "free-for-alls"—they were carefully managed by communities through customary rules and shared governance.

**The Tragedy**: The tragedy of the commons (Garrett Hardin's famous but misleading essay) wasn't about commons failing. It was about what happens when commons are destroyed—when collective management is replaced by private ownership or state control, and when community bonds break down.

Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize-winning research showed that communities *can* successfully manage commons when:
- Boundaries are clear
- Rules fit local conditions
- Those affected can participate in decisions
- Monitoring is community-based
- Sanctions are graduated
- Conflict resolution is accessible
- Rights to organize are recognized

In other words: when stewardship is collective, accountable, and adaptive.

## Modern Applications

So what does stewardship look like in the 21st century?

### Community Land Trusts

A community land trust (CLT) removes land from the private market. The trust—governed by community members—owns the land permanently. Individuals or organizations can lease the land long-term, but they can't speculate on it, can't extract its value for private gain.

This creates:
- Permanent affordability (housing stays accessible across generations)
- Community control (local governance rather than distant landlords)
- Long-term thinking (decisions prioritize collective benefit)

CLTs exist worldwide—urban and rural, large and small. They prove that another model is possible.

### Housing Cooperatives

In a housing co-op, residents collectively own and govern their housing. Not as individual property (you don't own your unit), but as shared stewardship (you're a member with rights and responsibilities).

Benefits include:
- Lower costs (no profit extraction by landlords or developers)
- Stability (co-ops don't flip properties for gain)
- Democratic control (residents make decisions together)
- Community building (you're invested in your neighbors' wellbeing)

### Limited Equity Models

These restrict how much profit you can make when you "sell" your stake in a property. You get back what you put in (plus maybe a modest return), but you can't capture speculative gains.

This keeps housing affordable across time and prevents gentrification—while still giving people security and a stake in their home.

### Stewardship Forests

Community forests, conservation easements, and rewilding projects that prioritize long-term ecological health over short-term timber extraction. The land is held in trust for future generations (human and more-than-human).

## Legal Innovations

The shift from property to stewardship requires new legal forms. Some emerging models:

**Benefit Corporations**: For-profit entities with a legal mandate to balance profit with social/environmental benefit.

**Purpose Trusts**: Assets held in perpetuity for a specific purpose (like ecological restoration) rather than for private benefit.

**Stewardship Enterprises**: Businesses structured so they can never be sold—they're held in trust for their workers, community, or mission.

**Indigenous Land Back**: Returning land to Indigenous stewardship—recognizing both historical injustice and the value of Indigenous ecological knowledge.

These aren't perfect, and they're all still navigating hostile legal/economic systems. But they point toward what's possible.

## The Inner Shift

Legal structures matter. But the deeper work is internal—shifting how we *think* about our relationship to resources.

**From Scarcity to Abundance**: Property thinking assumes scarcity ("there's not enough; I must secure mine"). Stewardship thinking recognizes abundance ("when we share well, there's enough").

**From Control to Care**: Property says "I can do what I want." Stewardship says "I'm responsible for this—not just to myself, but to the whole."

**From Extraction to Regeneration**: Property asks "how much can I take?" Stewardship asks "how can I leave this better than I found it?"

**From Individual to Collective**: Property isolates ("my house, my land, my problem"). Stewardship connects ("our neighborhood, our watershed, our shared future").

This shift doesn't happen overnight. It's developmental—moving through stages of understanding about ownership, control, and responsibility.

## Challenges and Tensions

Let's be honest: stewardship is *hard*.

**The Free Rider Problem**: What if some people take but don't give back? Commons require social accountability—and that requires relationship, trust, and sometimes difficult conversations.

**Decision-Making Complexity**: Collective governance is slower and messier than individual control. It requires skills in facilitation, conflict resolution, and patience.

**Legal/Financial Barriers**: Property law is deeply entrenched. Getting mortgages, insurance, zoning approval for commons-based models is often an uphill battle.

**The Tragedy of Scale**: Stewardship works best at human scale—where people know each other, where accountability is face-to-face. Scaling up requires new structures.

**Individual vs. Collective Needs**: Sometimes what's good for the commons conflicts with individual desires. How do we honor both?

These aren't reasons to give up. They're reasons to be realistic, creative, and committed to the long game.

## Stewardship as Practice

How do you actually cultivate stewardship thinking?

### 1. **Start Where You Are**

You don't need to own land to practice stewardship. You can be a steward of:
- Your rental home (tending it beyond legal obligation)
- Your neighborhood (organizing, caring for shared spaces)
- Your workplace (treating it as a commons, not just a job)
- Digital spaces (open-source, Creative Commons, community platforms)

Stewardship is a *relationship*, not a legal status.

### 2. **Ask Different Questions**

Instead of "What can I get from this?" ask:
- "How can I care for this?"
- "What does this place/project/community need?"
- "How can I leave this better for those who come after?"

### 3. **Build Relationships**

Stewardship is inherently relational. You can't steward alone. Get to know:
- Your neighbors
- The land/ecosystem you're part of
- The history of the place
- The people who came before and will come after

### 4. **Practice Long-Term Thinking**

Make decisions for decades, not quarters. Plant trees you won't live to see mature. Build systems that will outlast you.

### 5. **Learn from Indigenous Wisdom**

If you're on Indigenous land (which, in the Americas, is everywhere), learn from and support Indigenous-led stewardship. They've been doing this for millennia.

## Why This Matters for Communizing

The shift from property to stewardship isn't just about land or housing. It's about *how we relate to everything*.

If we see the world through the lens of property:
- Relationships become transactions
- People become resources
- Nature becomes raw material
- The future becomes something to discount

If we see the world through the lens of stewardship:
- Relationships become reciprocal
- People become partners in care
- Nature becomes kin
- The future becomes sacred trust

This shift ripples out:
- **In relationships**: From "my partner" to "our relationship to tend"
- **In parenting**: From "my children" to "young humans I'm stewarding into adulthood"
- **In work**: From "my career" to "gifts I'm offering in service of the whole"
- **In knowledge**: From "intellectual property" to "shared wisdom"

Everywhere, the question shifts from "what can I own/control?" to "what am I being called to tend?"

## The Commons as Becoming

Here's the deepest truth: the commons isn't a thing. It's a *practice*. It's something you do, not something you have.

You can't own a commons. You can only *common*—the verb, the action, the continuous practice of creating and maintaining shared resources through collective care.

Property tries to freeze reality—to make permanent claims on inherently flowing resources. Stewardship recognizes flow—you receive, you tend, you pass on. Nothing is static. Everything is relationship.

This is simultaneously humbling and empowering:
- Humbling because you're not in control. You're part of something larger.
- Empowering because you matter. Your care shapes what gets passed forward.

## Conclusion: The Invitation

The invitation of stewardship thinking is simple but radical:

What if you don't own anything—not really?

What if everything you have is on loan from the future, held in trust for those not yet born?

What if your job isn't to accumulate, but to tend? Not to control, but to care? Not to extract, but to regenerate?

This isn't about guilt or self-sacrifice. It's about *relationship*—with land, with community, with the more-than-human world, with time itself.

When you shift from property thinking to stewardship thinking, you don't lose something. You gain something immense: you become part of a web of reciprocity that extends backward through ancestors and forward through descendants. You become a link in a chain of care.

This is what it means to communize at the societal scale—to build structures that embody stewardship, to create legal forms that protect commons, to develop practices that regenerate rather than extract.

It starts with a simple question:

*What am I being called to steward?*

The answer will change your life. And maybe, if enough of us ask it, it will change the world.
