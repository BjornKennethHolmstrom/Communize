# The Economics of Care

What if an economy's success wasn't measured by GDP growth, but by how well it cares for its members?

What if the work that actually sustains life—feeding children, tending elders, healing trauma, building community—was valued as highly as the work that generates profit?

What if we designed economic systems around care, reciprocity, and regeneration rather than extraction, competition, and accumulation?

This isn't utopian fantasy. It's the practical necessity of our time—and the foundational logic of communizing at the societal scale.

## The Invisibility of Care

Our current economy has a massive blind spot: it doesn't see care work.

**Unpaid care work**—primarily done by women—includes:
- Raising children
- Caring for elderly or disabled family members  
- Cooking, cleaning, emotional labor
- Maintaining relationships and community bonds
- Tending to the sick
- Creating home as sanctuary

Globally, this amounts to **trillions of dollars** of value annually. Yet it doesn't appear in GDP. It's economically invisible.

**Low-paid care work** faces similar devaluation:
- Childcare workers
- Home health aides
- Teachers
- Social workers
- Nurses

These professions—essential to human flourishing—pay poverty wages while executives and financiers earn millions for work that often extracts rather than creates value.

The message is clear: the market doesn't value care. Which means the market fundamentally misunderstands what an economy is *for*.

## What Is an Economy, Really?

Let's return to basics.

An economy is a system for meeting human needs through the production and distribution of goods and services.

But *which* needs? And met *how*?

**Capitalist economy says**: Needs that can be profitably met will be met. Those that can't (or that belong to people without purchasing power) won't be. The logic is extraction—pull resources from nature and labor, convert them to commodities, sell them for more than they cost, accumulate the surplus.

**Care economy says**: All human needs for survival, thriving, and connection deserve to be met. The logic is regeneration—use resources to sustain and enhance life, distribute them according to need, create cycles that replenish rather than deplete.

One economy treats humans as resources to be exploited. The other treats humans as beings to be nurtured.

One economy sees nature as dead material to be used up. The other sees nature as living systems to be tended.

One economy measures success by quarterly profits. The other measures success by collective wellbeing.

These aren't minor differences. They're fundamentally different cosmologies.

## The Triple Crisis

Our current system—designed around extraction rather than care—is producing predictable crises:

**Ecological crisis**: Extractive economics treats the biosphere as infinite resource and infinite dump. The result: climate breakdown, mass extinction, poisoned water, depleted soil. You can't extract infinitely from finite systems.

**Social crisis**: Extractive economics creates winners and losers. The result: vast inequality, loneliness epidemics, community breakdown, mental health catastrophe. When care becomes unaffordable, people suffer.

**Care crisis**: As care work is devalued and defunded, the systems that hold us together fray. Parents can't afford childcare. Elders die alone. Teachers burn out. Communities fragment.

These aren't separate problems. They're the same problem: an economy that doesn't recognize care as its central purpose will destroy what it's supposed to sustain.

## What Would a Care Economy Look Like?

Imagine an economy that starts with different questions:

Not "how do we maximize growth?" but "how do we meet everyone's needs?"

Not "how do we increase productivity?" but "how do we distribute care equitably?"

Not "what generates profit?" but "what generates wellbeing?"

From these questions, different structures emerge:

### 1. **Universal Basic Services**

Rather than forcing people to purchase care on the market, provide it universally:
- Healthcare (including mental health, dental, vision)
- Childcare and education
- Elder care
- Housing
- Food security
- Community spaces

This isn't charity. It's recognizing that these are *preconditions for participation in any economy*. You can't work if you're sick, homeless, or caring for a child with no support.

### 2. **Valuing Care Work**

Care workers—whether paid or unpaid—should be recognized and compensated for the essential work they do.

One emerging model: **Hearts currency** within the [Nested Economies Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/nested-economies).

Hearts is a commons-based currency designed specifically to value care, ecological work, and community building—the contributions our current economy ignores.

How it works:
- Care workers, teachers, community organizers receive Hearts for their contributions
- Local councils charter "Community Providers" who deliver services redeemable for Hearts
- The "Love Ledger" tracks informal care (cooking for neighbors, childcare swaps, emotional support)
- Hearts can be exchanged for goods, services, and eventually converted to other currencies

The genius of Hearts is it makes visible what was invisible. Suddenly, the neighbor who watches your kids, the community health worker, the grandmother preserving traditional knowledge—all are recognized as contributing real economic value.

### 3. **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)**

The [AUBI Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/adaptive-universal-basic-income) provides a four-layered approach to economic security:

**Layer 1 - Universal Baseline**: Everyone receives enough to meet basic needs (food, shelter, healthcare). This isn't contingent on employment—it recognizes that every human deserves the foundation for life.

**Layer 2 - Contribution Bonuses**: Additional Hearts/Leaves currency for care work, ecological restoration, community service, cultural preservation. This values contributions the market ignores.

**Layer 3 - Equity Adjustments**: Extra support for those with disabilities, caretaking responsibilities, or facing systemic barriers. This recognizes that equal treatment doesn't mean equitable outcomes.

**Layer 4 - Crisis Stabilization**: Emergency funds during transitions, crises, or disasters. This provides resilience when systems break down.

Together, these layers create security *and* recognize contribution. You're not dependent on charity. You're receiving reciprocity for your participation in sustaining community.

### 4. **Time Banks and Mutual Aid**

These systems operate outside market logic entirely:

**Time banking**: One hour of your time = one hour of mine, regardless of what we do. The neurosurgeon's hour equals the poet's hour equals the gardener's hour. Value becomes relational rather than market-based.

**Mutual aid networks**: Neighbors helping neighbors without financial exchange. During COVID-19, mutual aid exploded—people organizing food deliveries, childcare, emotional support. These networks proved more responsive and trustworthy than many formal systems.

These models demonstrate that care economies already exist. They've always existed. They're just been made invisible by market logic.

### 5. **Cooperative Ownership**

When workers own their workplace, different values emerge:

Worker cooperatives tend to:
- Pay more equitable wages
- Prioritize job security over profit maximization
- Care about community impact
- Value quality of work life
- Think long-term

Examples include:
- Mondragon (Spain's largest co-op network, 80,000+ workers)
- Cooperation Jackson (building a cooperative economy in Mississippi)
- Green Bay Packers (community-owned NFL team)
- Credit unions (member-owned banks)

When ownership is shared, care for the whole becomes rational self-interest.

## The Gender Dimension

Any discussion of care economics must confront gender.

Globally, women perform **three times as much unpaid care work** as men. This invisible labor subsidizes the entire economy—enabling men to work outside the home while women work inside it (often in addition to outside work).

This isn't natural. It's structural.

A genuine care economy would:
- **Value care work** (making it visible, well-paid, and respected)
- **Redistribute care work** (men sharing equally in domestic and emotional labor)
- **Socialize care work** (collective childcare, elder care, community kitchens)
- **Stop penalizing caregivers** (career advancement shouldn't require sacrificing care)

The devaluation of care work is inseparable from the devaluation of women's work. An economy that centers care must also center gender justice.

## The Racial Dimension

Similarly, care work has always been racialized.

In the US, enslaved Black women were forced to nurse white children while denied the ability to care for their own. Today, care work—especially the most undervalued aspects like cleaning and home health care—is disproportionately done by women of color, often immigrants.

A care economy must reckon with this history:
- **Fair wages** for care workers (who are disproportionately BIPOC)
- **Labor protections** (many care workers are excluded from minimum wage and overtime laws)
- **Immigration justice** (many care workers are undocumented, making them vulnerable to exploitation)
- **Cultural respect** (honoring diverse traditions of care and healing)

Economic justice and racial justice are inseparable.

## Measuring What Matters

GDP measures economic activity—including car crashes, oil spills, and arms sales. More activity = higher GDP, regardless of whether it improves life.

A care economy needs different metrics. Some emerging models:

**The Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**: Part of the Hearts economy framework, LMCI measures:
- Quality of relationships (40% weight)
- Sense of purpose and meaning (30%)
- Community connection (30%)

Rather than measuring transactions, it measures wellbeing.

**Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)**: Adjusts GDP by:
- Adding value of unpaid work
- Subtracting costs of inequality, pollution, crime
- Accounting for resource depletion

GPI often shows flat or declining progress where GDP shows growth.

**Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics**: Maps social foundation (meeting everyone's needs) and ecological ceiling (staying within planetary boundaries). Success means operating in the space between—meeting needs without destroying ecosystems.

These aren't perfect, but they point toward measuring what actually matters: are people cared for? Are communities thriving? Is the planet healthy?

## The Transition Challenge

"This all sounds lovely," you might say, "but how do we get there from here?"

Fair question. The existing system won't simply collapse. And people can't stop eating while we redesign the economy.

**Transition strategies include:**

**Parallel institutions**: Build care-based systems alongside extractive ones. Hearts economies, mutual aid networks, time banks, co-ops—all operating now, proving viability.

**Policy reforms**: Universal healthcare, childcare, AUBI—incrementally shifting public investment from extraction to care.

**Cultural shift**: Changing stories about work, value, success. Recognizing care workers as essential rather than unskilled. Redefining "productivity" to include care, creativity, and community.

**Legal innovation**: New ownership structures (community land trusts, stewardship enterprises, benefit corporations) that protect care-based organizations from market pressures.

**Crisis response**: Each crisis (pandemic, climate disaster, economic collapse) creates openings for alternative systems. Mutual aid explodes. People remember we need each other.

The transition is already happening. We're in it. The question is whether we accelerate it intentionally or wait for collapse to force our hand.

## Why This Matters for Communizing

Care economies aren't just about economics. They're about *fundamentally different ways of being in relationship*.

Extractive economics says: "I take what I can get. You're competition. Resources are scarce. I must secure mine."

Care economics says: "We take care of each other. You're kin. Resources are abundant when shared. My wellbeing depends on yours."

One creates isolation, anxiety, and depletion. The other creates connection, security, and regeneration.

One sees humans as individuals in competition. The other sees humans as interdependent members of communities.

At every scale—inner, relational, societal, planetary—the choice is the same: extraction or care, isolation or connection, depletion or regeneration.

The societal scale is where this becomes visible in economic structures. Where it becomes concrete in how we organize work, distribute resources, and value contributions.

When we build care economies, we're not just rearranging the deck chairs. We're changing the ship's destination—from extraction to regeneration, from accumulation to circulation, from separation to belonging.

## Practical Steps

So what can you actually do?

**Individual level:**
- Recognize and name care work you do and receive
- Support care workers (tip well, advocate for better pay and conditions)
- Participate in mutual aid networks
- Use Hearts or similar alternative currencies if available in your area

**Community level:**
- Start or join a time bank
- Organize community care cooperatives (childcare, elder care, meal prep)
- Advocate for universal basic services in your municipality
- Support local worker-owned businesses

**Policy level:**
- Support candidates who advocate for care policies
- Push for AUBI implementation
- Demand living wages for care workers
- Fund community care infrastructure

**Cultural level:**
- Tell stories that value care over accumulation
- Challenge narratives that treat care work as unskilled
- Celebrate caregivers (not just on one day)
- Model care in your own life and speak about it publicly

## Conclusion: The Work That Matters

At the end of our lives, what will have mattered?

Not how much we accumulated. Not how many hours we worked. Not our job titles or status.

What will have mattered is: Did we care well? Were we cared for? Did we build communities of mutual support? Did we contribute to life?

An economy centered on care simply acknowledges this truth and organizes accordingly.

It says: The work that sustains life *is* the work that matters. Let's value it as such. Let's build systems that make it possible for everyone to give care and receive care throughout their lives.

This isn't about being nice. It's about survival. Extractive economics is killing us—literally, through ecological collapse, and figuratively, through isolation and despair.

Care economics offers a different possibility: economies of regeneration rather than depletion, of connection rather than isolation, of enough rather than endless more.

This is the work of communizing at the societal scale—building economic systems that recognize we're all in this together, that my wellbeing depends on yours, that care is the ground on which everything else rests.

It's possible. Models exist. The transition is underway.

The question is: will you participate?
